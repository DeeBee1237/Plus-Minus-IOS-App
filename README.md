# Plus-Minus-IOS-App

This is a simple ios app that I spent a few hours on. It displays a number at the top, and has a plus and minus button which you can use
to change the value of the number, and the app will update the number on the screen. This was mainly done for fun 
and to start learning about Objective C and IOS.
